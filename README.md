Running Tests
-------------

### Python
Before you will be able to run these tests you will need to have Python 2.6 installed.

####Virtualenv and Virtualenvwrapper (Optional/Intermediate level)
While most of us have had some experience using virtual machines, [virtualenv][venv] is something else entirely.  It's used to keep libraries that you install from clashing and messing up your local environment.  After installing virtualenv, installing [virtualenvwrapper][wrapper] will give you some nice commands to use with virtualenvwrapper.

[venv]: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
[wrapper]: http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/

__note__

If you do not use virtualenv, you can follow the instructions below to install
the required Python libraries into your global Python installation.

If you don't mind installing globally, just run

    sudo easy_install pip

followed by

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

__note__

If you are running on Ubuntu/Debian you will need to first do

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

to install the required Python libraries.

### Running tests locally

To run tests locally it's a simple case of calling py.test from the root directory.

    py.test --driver=firefox

For more command line options see https://github.com/davehunt/pytest-mozwebqa
